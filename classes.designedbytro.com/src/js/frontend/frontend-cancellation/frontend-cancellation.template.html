      <h2>For Open Studio Sessions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Due to the high demand for open studio time, we have had to put in the following cancellation policy. </li>
        <li>If you are signed up for a spot, please cancel more than 24 hours before the start of class, either by text or email.  </li>
        <li>We appreciate that things come up unexpectedly, so for each 5 session open studio subscription, you may cancel less than 24 hours in advance one time (i.e. we wonâ€™t mark it off of your subscription).  After that, the class will be deducted from your subscription.</li>
